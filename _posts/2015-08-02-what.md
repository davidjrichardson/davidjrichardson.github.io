Chiron is a data intensive computer cluster from both the Centre of Urban Science and Planning, and the Mathematics for Real-world Systems CDT at Warwick. It is managed by Warwick’s Centre of Scientific Computing.

The cluster itself is built upon a standard Apache software stack:

* HDFS (Distributed filesystem),
* YARN (Resource management),
* Hadoop (Bulk data analysis) — MapR distribution,
* Storm (Streaming data analyis).

The cluster also comes with a number of different accelerator nodes, scheduled using SLURM, to form a platform of research into their use within data analytics. The cluster’s architecture is heterogenous in nature, where each part is optimised for a specific purpose:

* Bulk/Offline:
  * Uses MapR Hadoop,
  * 28x Nodes,
  * Mix of HDDs (6TB capacity) and SSDs (3GB capacity),
  * **156TB total storage**.
* Streaming/Online:
  * Uses Apache Storm,
  * 32x 64GB RAM, 20 core nodes,
  * **Total 2TB RAM, 640 CPU cores**.
* In-memory Analytics:
  * **1x 4TB RAM, 48-core system**.
* Accelerator research platform
  * 2x Nvidia K40 12GB nodes,
  * 2x Intel Xeon Phi 16GB nodes,
  * **2x Nallatech 395 FPGA 32GB nodes**.
* All nodes use **InfiniBand interconnects** to facilitate their use as a cohesive whole.
